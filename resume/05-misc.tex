I enjoy learning natural languages, snowboarding, slack-lining, trampoline gymnastics and motorcycle riding. I've been doing martial arts for close to 14 years, but still consider the long path ahead of me. I speak Russian and English fluently, and currently getting better with Japanese and Esperanto. I'm curious about Ithkuil, but who can learn that, seriously? I like shooting my rifles and pistols but not really any good at it so far. I used to play airsoft back in the day. Quirky fact - at some point in time when I was selling airsoft equipment, due to sluggish legal process, weapons with muzzle velocity of over 500 feet per second were considered firearms. So for all intents and purposes I was an arms dealer.
